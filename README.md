# python-TDD-stringcalculator
This is an excercise to coding, refactoring and test first following the TDD life cycle.

# Steps
    Create a simple String calculator with a method int Add(string numbers)

    The method can take 0, 1 or 2 numbers, and will return their sum (for an empty string it will return 0) for example “” or “1” or “1,2”
    Start with the simplest test case of an empty string and move to 1 and two numbers.
    
    Especially thanks to Roy Osherove's Blog. I found this exercise (also the solution ) and other similar exercises in him blog.
    
    Note: The tests and functions commented are useless before the refactoring.
